			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance README with clear value proposition and decision guide",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down README enhancement into manageable content sections: 1) Draft compelling opening value proposition (200 words), 2) Create decision flowchart content and visual for macro use cases, 3) Develop before/after comparison examples for dynamic scenarios, 4) Build 5-minute Quick Start section with working example, 5) Reorganize existing installation and content for better flow, 6) Add prominent DocC documentation links and cross-references",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity based on existing README structure. Requires content strategy, example development, and reorganization but builds on current foundation. Current README is basic with simple example - needs strategic reframing rather than complete rewrite."
