⏺ Context Analysis

  Current Situation:
  - 0 tasks in-progress (clear to start fresh)
  - 8 pending tasks available
  - 20% project completion (2/10 tasks done)
  - Task 3 has high priority and is unblocked

  Next Recommended Task:

  Task 3: Create 'When to Use SyntaxKit' DocC Tutorial

  - Priority: High
  - Status: Ready to start (dependency Task 2 is complete)
  - Complexity: Medium (6/10)
  - First Subtask: Research decision criteria framework (3.1)

  Why this task:
  - Highest priority available
  - Addresses core user confusion about SyntaxKit's purpose
  - Foundation for other documentation tasks
  - Ready to start immediately

  Preparation Steps:
  1. Research existing decision frameworks
  2. Analyze SyntaxKit use cases in codebase
  3. Study Swift ecosystem patterns

  Quick Alternative: Start with Task 5 (Quick Start tutorial) if you prefer a simpler entry point.

  Ready to begin Task 3?

> yes

⏺ Perfect! I'll start working on Task 3 - the "When to Use SyntaxKit" DocC tutorial. Let me begin by setting the
  task status and diving into the first subtask.

⏺ task-master-ai - set_task_status (MCP)(id: "3", status: "in-progress", projectRoot:
                                        "/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/SyntaxKit")

⏺ Now let me start researching decision criteria frameworks by examining the existing codebase and documentation to
  understand SyntaxKit's current positioning and use cases.

⏺ Now I need to create the "When to Use SyntaxKit" tutorial. Based on my analysis, I can see there's already
  excellent decision-making content scattered across the README and Documentation.md, but we need a focused tutorial
   that consolidates this into a step-by-step learning experience. Let me create the tutorial file.

     # When to Use SyntaxKit
     Learn the key decision criteria for choosing SyntaxKit vs manual Swift code, with practical examples and
     decision frameworks.
     ## Overview
     This tutorial guides you through the essential decision-making process for when SyntaxKit provides value over
     manual Swift development. You'll learn to identify scenarios where programmatic code generation excels,
     understand performance trade-offs, and avoid common anti-patterns.
