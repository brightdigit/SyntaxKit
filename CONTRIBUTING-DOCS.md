# Contributing to SyntaxKit Documentation

This guide establishes standards and processes for reviewing and contributing to SyntaxKit's documentation.

## Documentation Types

SyntaxKit uses several types of documentation that require different review approaches:

### 1. DocC Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Inline code documentation (`///` comments)
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides in `/Documentation.docc/Tutorials/`
- **Articles**: Conceptual guides in `/Documentation.docc/Articles/`
- **Landing Page**: Main documentation overview (`Documentation.docc/Documentation.md`)

### 2. Repository Documentation
- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start
- **CLAUDE.md**: AI assistant context and development guidelines
- **Contributing guides**: This file and related contribution documentation

## Review Process

### For Documentation Contributors

1. **Before Submitting PR**
   - [ ] Run through the complete review checklist
   - [ ] Test all code examples in a clean environment
   - [ ] Generate DocC documentation locally to verify rendering
   - [ ] Proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity

2. **PR Description Requirements**
   - [ ] Clearly describe documentation changes made
   - [ ] Explain motivation for changes or new content
   - [ ] List any dependencies on code changes
   - [ ] Include screenshots for visual/layout changes

### For Documentation Reviewers

1. **Initial Review**
   - [ ] Verify PR follows the documentation review checklist
   - [ ] Check that all required information is provided
   - [ ] Identify any missing or incomplete sections

2. **Technical Review**
   - [ ] Verify all code examples compile and run
   - [ ] Check accuracy of API references and technical details
   - [ ] Test tutorial steps in clean environment
   - [ ] Validate external links and cross-references

3. **Content Review**
   - [ ] Assess clarity and readability for target audience
   - [ ] Check consistency with existing documentation style
   - [ ] Verify logical flow and organization
   - [ ] Suggest improvements for user experience

4. **Final Approval Requirements**
   - [ ] All checklist items addressed satisfactorily
   - [ ] Code examples tested and confirmed working
   - [ ] Content meets SyntaxKit quality standards
   - [ ] Changes align with project goals and direction

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Writing Style
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable, avoid overly casual language
- **Voice**: Use active voice when possible
- **Perspective**: Write from the user's perspective, focus on their goals
- **Complexity**: Start simple, build complexity gradually

### Code Examples
- **Completeness**: Examples should be complete and runnable
- **Relevance**: Examples should solve real-world problems
- **Progression**: Build from simple to complex examples
- **Comments**: Include explanatory comments for complex logic

### Structure Requirements
- **Headings**: Use semantic heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for unordered items, numbers for sequences
- **Links**: Use descriptive link text, avoid "click here" or bare URLs
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting

## Common Documentation Issues

### ❌ Issues to Avoid
- Placeholder text or incomplete sections
- Code examples that don't compile or run
- Broken internal or external links
- Inconsistent terminology across documentation
- Missing context or assumptions about user knowledge
- Overly complex examples for introductory content
- Documentation that contradicts actual API behavior
- Missing error handling in code examples

### ✅ Best Practices
- Test all code examples in isolation
- Include both simple and advanced examples
- Provide context for when to use different approaches
- Link to related documentation and external resources
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- Show both success and error handling scenarios
- Keep examples focused and purposeful

## Tools and Validation

### Required Checks Before Approval
1. **Compilation**: All Swift code examples must compile
2. **Link Validation**: All links must resolve correctly
3. **DocC Generation**: Documentation must build without warnings
4. **Spelling/Grammar**: Use spell check and grammar validation
5. **Consistency**: Verify consistency with existing documentation

### Local Testing Commands
```bash
# Generate DocC documentation locally
swift package generate-documentation

# Run code quality checks (includes documentation linting)
./Scripts/lint.sh

# Test Swift code examples
swift build && swift test
```

## Reviewer Assignment

### Primary Reviewers
