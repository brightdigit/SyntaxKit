## Quality Assurance Process

### Automated Validation Pipeline

```bash
# Daily CI/CD checks (run on every PR)
./Scripts/validate-docs.sh      # Link validation and cross-references
./Scripts/api-coverage.sh       # API documentation coverage (90% threshold)
swift package generate-documentation  # DocC build validation
./Scripts/lint.sh               # Code quality including documentation
```

### Review Checkpoints

#### For Every Pull Request
- [ ] All new public APIs have documentation comments
- [ ] Code examples compile and run
- [ ] Internal links and cross-references work
- [ ] Changes don't break existing documentation

#### Monthly Review Checklist
- [ ] External links are functional
- [ ] Installation instructions work with current versions
- [ ] Quick start examples run successfully
- [ ] API coverage meets 90% threshold
- [ ] No placeholder or TODO content remains

#### Quarterly Review Checklist
- [ ] All tutorials can be completed as written
- [ ] Documentation structure serves user journey
- [ ] New user onboarding is smooth and complete
- [ ] Advanced topics are adequately covered
- [ ] Community feedback has been addressed

## Ownership Responsibilities

## Documentation Debt Management

### Identification Process
1. **Automated Detection**
   - CI/CD flags missing documentation
   - Link validation identifies broken references
   - API coverage reports highlight gaps

2. **Community Feedback**
   - GitHub issues tagged with 'documentation'
   - Support questions indicating unclear documentation
   - User feedback on tutorial completion

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly reviews identify outdated content
   - Quarterly audits assess structural issues
   - Release reviews catch version-specific problems

### Prioritization Framework

#### High Priority (Fix within 1 week)
- Broken links or compilation errors
- Missing documentation for new public APIs
- Critical user onboarding blockers
- Security-related documentation gaps

#### Medium Priority (Fix within 1 month)
- Outdated examples or tutorials
- Minor inaccuracies in existing documentation
- Missing advanced usage examples
- Documentation style inconsistencies

#### Low Priority (Fix within 1 quarter)
- Documentation structure improvements
- Additional examples for edge cases
- Enhanced troubleshooting guides
- Performance optimization documentation

### Debt Resolution Process
